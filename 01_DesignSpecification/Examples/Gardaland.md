## Pros

- Visually, the site is attractive at first, nice icons and very pretty
- App download link
- Information given on the pages is on topic and useful

## Cons

- Main menu appears disorganized and too busy. The main menu has restaurants under Short breaks, and as a separate menu item. The section "New" is too abstract, and it is not clear what is inside.
- The call to action to buy tickets and prices blends with the site design - although pretty, it does not focus attention
- The pricing page https://abbonamenti.gardaland.it/gdl_season/seasonpass.html looks like a pricing of a web service with different features, rather than a theme park
- There search box does not appear to do anything
- There are weird navigation elements to the right of the page, not bringing additional value to the experience
