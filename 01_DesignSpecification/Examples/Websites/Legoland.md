## Pros

- Well planned design
- Main menu gives quick access to every area of interest
- Booking area in the footer stands out and is easy to use
- All website visuals are lego based which is a great touch

## Cons

- It appears the website design is mobile-first, as it looks the same on desktop and mobile. Although this gives a good experience for mobile, it comes with the tradeoff that on desktop the header element has empty space where you would expect important links
