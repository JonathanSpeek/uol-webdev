## Pros

- Minimalistic design without much clutter
- Most information can be accessed from the menu and footer
- Beautiful interactive map of the theme park
- Attractions page is minimalistic, I like the left explanation element for attractions - https://www.walibi.be/en/attractions/fun-pilot - give information about age group, height requirements, speed, and duration

## Cons

- The categorical pages can be overwhelming, for example: https://www.walibi.be/en/restaurants - it is not clear what I want to visit and I must browse through all items
- Very little information given about some venues, for example: https://www.walibi.be/en/restaurants/rock-freeze - we learn where to find it, but not much information what we can buy.
