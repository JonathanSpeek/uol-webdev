# Wire Frames

The wire frames below will act as a guide for creating the webpage layouts. For each page we have a layout for wide screens that would be suitable for desktops/tablets and a layout for small screens that would be suitable for mobile devices. We have selected three pages to create for the project:
* Home
* Tickets & Passes
* Events, Venues and Attractions

## Page 1 - Home

**Home - Wide Screen**
