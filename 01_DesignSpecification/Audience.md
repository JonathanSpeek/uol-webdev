# How does the theme park meet the needs of its Audience?

To meet its purpose, the theme park website must meet the needs of its audience. Before the theme park website can meet the needs of its audience, the audience must be outlined. Most theme parks are targeted at the mass market, rather than a niche audience. This means that the website needs to be able to satisfy the needs of the general audience. It should take into account what is generally considered to be in "good taste," the minimal expected IT-aptitude of the theme-park visitor, and how it can stand out when compared to other theme parks.

From the mass market, there are certain categories of people that are more likely to visit the website:
* People who already want to visit the theme park.
* People who aren't sure if they wan't to visit the theme park.
* People who are looking for an idea for a day out.
* People who want to raise a complaint.
* People looking for a way to contact the theme park for another reason.
* People just browsing the internet.

As more data about theme park visitors becomes available, more specific demographic-based targeting can be introduced. When such data is not available, it's best to aim for a more general approach.

To meet its purpose, the website should appeal to most of the groups of people listed. 

### People who already want to visit the theme park.

To meet the needs of this audience, the website should allow visitors to purchase tickets as easily as possible, and outline the different options to purchase tickets.

### People who aren't sure if they wan't to visit the theme park.

The website should look appealing, and clearly show off its main attractions. Ideally, it should showcase a variety of exhibits so that there's something that appeals to as many people as possible. 

### People who are looking for an idea for a day out.

To meet the needs of this audience, the website needs to hit similar criteria as above (i.e. it should showcase a variety of exhibits and have clear pricing). It should also include any features that differentiate it form the competitors.

### People who want to raise a complaint.

It's important that as many complaints as possible can be addressed by the theme park directly, rather than being publicly aired on social media. To meet the needs of this audience, contact details of the theme park should be easily available.

### People looking for a way to contact the theme park for another reason.

Meeting the needs of this audience is very similar as to that above - the contact details should easily be available on the website.

### People just browsing the internet.

This group will include a number of people who could visit the theme park in the future, or share what they saw with people they know. To make this more likely, the website should look modern, have low loading times, and clearly showcase its attractions.
