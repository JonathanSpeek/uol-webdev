# What is the purpose of a theme park website?

The purpose of the website is to help the theme park achieve its mission. For a typical theme park, this will mean increasing revenue and profitability.

The mission of increasing revenue can be done in the following ways:
* Ramping up existing revenue streams.
* Tapping into new revenue streams.
* Reducing losses.

## Ramping up existing revenue streams

The easiest way for a website to achieve its purpose is by contributing to ramping up existing revenue streams. This can include:
* Inciting new visitors to visit the park.
* Inciting returning visitors to visit the park.
* Selling merchandice.

## Tapping into new revenue streams

Another way for a website to achieve its purpose is by helping set up new revenue streams. This could be done by:
* "Hybrid" attractions (i.e. online interactions that result in immediate actual changes at the park).
* Providing an interactive, online-only experience. This would allow the park to achieve its mission even during closure periods, for instance due to COVID.

## Reducing losses

A theme park can lose revenue or profit if an existing revenue stream is impacted. A website can help the website to achieve its mission by reducing the likelihood of this occuring. This can be done by:
* Providing an online way to report any negative experiences, including safety concerns. This means that, something that might have been aired on social media may be received as a complaint instead. This reduces potential social media risk.
